How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
=============================

This module introduces a text indentation function named ``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage
=====

The function processes input text and adds indentation after each period (.) or colon (:).

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text = "This is a sample text. It has multiple sentences. Each sentence should be indented."
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    This is a sample text.
    It has multiple sentences.
    Each sentence should be indented.

If the input text is an empty string, the function does nothing.

::

    >>> text_indentation("")
    (no output)

Invalid Input
=============

The parameter ``text`` must be a string. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> text_indentation(["not a string"])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation(123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

If the input text contains neither a period nor a colon, the function leaves it unchanged.

::

    >>> text = "This text does not need indentation"
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    This text does not need indentation

Ensure that at least one argument is provided.

::

    >>> text_indentation()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'
